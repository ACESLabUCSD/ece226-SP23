title: Optimization and Acceleration of Deep Learning on Various Hardware Platforms
description: ECE 226 • Spring 2023 • UC San Diego
news: true
---

This course aims to present the mathematical, and computational challenges for holistic content/algorithm/hardware co-design of an efficient Deep Learning (DL) framework. We will discuss selected DL topics including DNNs, CNNs, GNN and Transformers in both supervised and unsupervised settings. Special emphasis will be on optimizing DL physical performance (e.g., real-time performance, energy, memory, and power) on different hardware platforms.
